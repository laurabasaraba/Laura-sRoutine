          Hi! I'm Laura and these are some things about me.
          This world of clean aesthetic girls fascinates me very much. I love coffe and fancy cafes. In the feature I plan to open such a place. I love skin products and I always try to keep my face hydrated and healthy. I really hope that these things help you to know me better.

          Every morning I started to clean my face with a special cleaning gel and a small device to remove all impurities. After my face is clean I apply a cream containing vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and at the end I apply spf to protect myself from the sun's rays. Thus, throughout the whole day, my face feels hydrated. In the evening, I clean my skin again with the cleansing gel and apply a moisturizing cream.
          I hope my skincare routine will help you too!

          I like to dress casually, in light and bright colors. For me, combining different clothing items to make them look good is a satisfaction. Also, accessorizing outfits is a challenge that I accept with joy.
          Some of my favorite pieces of clothing are white sweaters, flared pants and simple tops.
          As accessories I prefer simple earrings, small bags and rings made of rosy silver.
          The shoes I prefer are the black ones, and I like sneakers in light colors.

          Besides all my casual clothing style, I also find myself very much in this exclusive life, with outfits that are as simple as they are sophisticated.
          I also try to combine both lifestyles, enjoying the moments I spend in the company of loved ones.
          Even if now the exclusive life style is not very visible, in the future I am convinced that I will find a balance in both.
